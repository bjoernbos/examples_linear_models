# Learn how to improve your linear models
This repository contains all examples and R code of my Medium article on ["How you can use linear regression models to predict quadratic, root, and polynomial functions"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-improve-your-linear-models-8294bfa8a731).

## Getting Started
You can deploy all examples directly after downloading. You do not need to installed further packages. I recommend using RStudio as you can easily browse through the code and graphs side by side.

### Run these examples
There are two ways to run the examples:
1. Either open the script, highlight an section and hit run or
2. Change directory to the script and run: `source("examples_linear_models.R")`

## Build With
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org) Version 3.4.0
